# MTA-Simple-Application

This was a project that was done in Fall 2018 in CS370 Software Engineering at CUNY Queens College. This was part of the final project that everyone int he entire class worked on. The task was to create a program that would satisfy the user to have a better and easier way to navigate from the mta.info website (The professor rndomly selected websites and assigned to the students. I got mta.info). I used Java to create the program. Unfortunately most of the code I had was corrupt and was not able to retrieve them on time. The project was 60% done. Only issue the program has was the register and login and the widgets which creates topics buttons (e.g bus, train, LIRR, etc...) which will take directly to that topic.


UPDATE: I am currently working on improving the program using Spring Boot and MySQL to modify the database.
